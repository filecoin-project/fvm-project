# Error Conditions

This document specifies the error conditions in the FVM and the associated error codes/numbers.

**Conventions:**

Names in this document match those used in the [reference FVM implementation](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm):

- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` names are exit codes.
    - The `SYS_` prefix namespaces "system" exit codes.
    - The `USR_` prefix namespaces "user" (or "standard") exit codes.
- `CamelCase` names are error numbers.

## Exit Codes

Exit codes are numeric, 32bit integer codes that signal the outcome of the execution.

A 0 exit code (`OK`) is an _implied_ exit code: it is generated when the actor returns normally. This is the only exit code that can carry a return _value_ (an arbitrary IPLD object).

Non-zero exit code are either:

1. _explicitly_ signalled by an actor through an early `abort` operation
2. _explicitly_ generated by the VM because it encountered an abnormality during execution

In both cases, a non-zero exit code indicates that execution was interrupted and that the actors
state was left unchanged. A non-zero exit code may _not_ be accompanied by a return value.

Exit codes appear on-chain inside the message receipt, and therefore form part of consensus.

### System Non-Zero Exit Codes

System non-zero exit codes are generated by the VM itself to indicate that the message itself failed
to apply. Actors may not call `vm::abort` with any system exit code.

| Code  | Status                     | Description                                                |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | `SYS_SENDER_INVALID`       | sender doesn't exist                                       |
| 2     | `SYS_SENDER_STATE_INVALID` | message sender is not in a valid state to send the message |
| 3     | reserved                   |                                                            |
| 4     | `SYS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION`  | message receiver trapped                                   |
| 5     | `SYS_INVALID_RECEIVER`     | receiver doesn't exist and can't be automatically created  |
| 6     | `SYS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`   | sender didn't have the requisite funds                     |
| 7     | `SYS_OUT_OF_GAS`           | out of gas                                                 |
| 8     | reserved                   |                                                            |
| 9     | `SYS_ILLEGAL_EXIT_CODE`    | message receiver aborted with an system exit code          |
| 10    | `SYS_ASSERTION_FAILED`     | some internal assertion failed                             |
| 11    | `SYS_MISSING_RETURN`       | the actor returned a block handle that doesn't exist       |
| 12-15 | reserved                   |                                                            |

Notes:

1. If a message sender doesn't exist on-chain, the VM will return a receipt with the
   `SYS_SENDER_INVALID` exit code.
2. If an actor calls `vm::abort` with a system exit code, that exit code will be replaced with
   `SYS_ILLEGAL_EXIT_CODE`.
3. If an actor [traps][trap] (often a memory violation), the exit code `SYS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION`
   will be returned. User-level assertions (e.g., a go/rust panic, an uncaught exception, etc.)
   should cleanly abort with `USR_ASSERTION_FAILED`. `SYS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION` means that the actor
   failed in a way that it couldn't (or didn't) handle itself.
4. If a message runs out of gas, the VM will return a receipt with the `SYS_OUT_OF_GAS` exit code.
5. Most of these exit codes are only reflected on-chain and will not be observed in internal sends.
   The exceptions are:
    - `SYS_ILLEGAL_EXIT_CODE` if the called actor aborted with a system exit code.
    - `SYS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION` if the called actor crashed.
    - `SYS_MISSING_RETURN` if the actor returns an invalid block handle.
6. The VM raises fatal errors when it encounters system-level unexpected condition during message
   execution. These errors are severe, and usually indicate a correctness flaw. Either something
   is found to be broken at runtime (e.g. state tree cannot be decoded, init actor is not found,
   etc.), or we've hit some kind of programming error. When this happens, the VM produces a consensus
   outcome by stamping the `SYS_ASSERTION_FAILED` exit code on the receipt of the offending message.
   For context, read [filecoin-project/ref-fvm#508](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm/issues/508).

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

1. Removed `SYS_INVALID_METHOD` (3). Dispatch is now handled inside actor code which should exit
   with the equivalent `USR_UNHANDLED_MESSAGE`.
2. Removed `SYS_FORBIDDEN` (8). Caller verification is a userspace operation, we'll now exit with
   `USR_FORBIDDEN`.
3. Replaced `SYS_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT` with `SYS_ASSERTION_FAILED` to more accurately reflect its usage.
   When this appears on-chain, it means that a message hit some internal Filecoin assert that
   shouldn't happen.

### Standard Non-Zero Exit  Codes

Standard non-zero exit codes are codes returned by actors to indicate common failure conditions.

| Code  | Status                   | Description                                         |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 16    | `USR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT`   | invalid message parameters                          |
| 17    | `USR_NOT_FOUND`          | message referenced something that doesn't exist     |
| 18    | `USR_FORBIDDEN`          | operation forbidden                                 |
| 19    | `USR_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | insufficient funds for operation                    |
| 20    | `USR_ILLEGAL_STATE`      | the actor is in an illegal state                    |
| 21    | `USR_SERIALIZATION`      | actor failed to serialize or deserialize some state |
| 22    | `USR_UNHANDLED_MESSAGE`  | actor cannot handle this message                    |
| 23    | `USR_UNSPECIFIED`        | the actor failed with an unspecified error          |
| 24    | `USR_ASSERTION_FAILED`   | the actor failed some user-level assertion          |
| 25-31 | reserved                 |                                                     |

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

1. Added `USR_UNHANDLED_MESSAGE` (replacing `SYS_INVALID_METHOD`).
2. Added `USR_UNSPECIFIED`. This indicates that something unspecified went wrong, but we don't know
   what the cause is. This is a sane default exit code when accurately determining the underlying
   error is expensive, unreliable, complex, etc.
3. Added `USR_ASSERTION_FAILED`. This means that the actor failed some user-level assertion (e.g.,
   the actor paniced, threw an uncaught exception, etc.).

## Syscall Error Numbers

Syscall error numbers ([`ErrorNumber`][errno]) are returned by [syscalls][] to actors. They indicate
that the syscall failed (without any side effects). The actor may choose to handle the error and
continue, or abort (usually with one of the standard non-zero exit codes).

A return value of "0" means that the syscall succeeded.

| Number | Name                | Description                                            |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `IllegalArgument`   | invalid syscall parameters                             |
| 2      | `IllegalOperation`  | actor is not in the correct state to perform operation |
| 3      | `LimitExceeded`     | some limit was exceeded (e.g. lookback limit)          |
| 4      | `AssertionFailed`   | some internal assertion failed                         |
| 5      | `InsufficientFunds` | attempted to send more than balance                    |
| 6      | `NotFound`          | resource not found                                     |
| 7      | `InvalidHandle`     | block handle invalid                                   |
| 8      | `IllegalCid`        | cid creation parameters (hash/length) were invalid     |
| 9      | `IllegalCodec`      | specified codec is not allowed                         |
| 10     | `Serialization`     | block format did not match specified codec             |
| 11     | `Forbidden`         | operation is forbidden                                 |
| 12     | `BufferTooSmall`    | the output buffer is too small                         |

Before the FVM, Filecoin didn't have a concept of syscall error numbers, only exit codes. However:

1. Pre-FVM, most syscalls returned string errors with no exit codes attached.
2. There is no reliable mapping from syscall errors to exit codes. For example:

    1. If a syscall returns `IllegalArgument`, it means that an illegal argument was passed to
       the syscall.
    2. If an actor exits with `USR_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT`, it means the message parameters weren't allowed.

    1 does not imply 2. An actor may pass illegal arguments to a syscall due to a bug in the actor,
    illegal state, etc.

**Notes:**

- We intentionally use `IllegalArgument` instead of `Serialization` in non-IPLD syscalls, even if
    we're using CBOR.
- `AssertionFailed` is a special error that indicates that some internal assertion failed and that
    there is likely something wrong with a system actor or the Filecoin state-tree itself. It exists
    to allow the network to continue in the face of bugs where the network continuing is likely less
    harmful than the bug itself. This error isn't currently used.
