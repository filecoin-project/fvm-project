# Error Conditions

This document specifies the error conditions in the FVM and the associated error codes/numbers.

## Exit Codes

Exit codes are numeric, 32bit integer codes that signal the outcome of the execution.

A 0 exit code (`Ok`) is an _implied_ exit code: it is generated when the actor returns normally. This is the only exit code that can carry a return _value_ (an arbitrary IPLD object).

Non-zero exit code are either:

1. _explicitly_ signalled by an actor through an early `abort` operation
2. _explicitly_ generated by the VM because it encountered an abnormality during execution

In both cases, a non-zero exit code indicates that execution was interrupted and that the actors
state was left unchanged. A non-zero exit code may _not_ be accompanied by a return value.

Exit codes appear on-chain inside the message receipt, and therefore form part of consensus.

### System Non-Zero Exit Codes

System non-zero exit codes are generated by the VM itself to indicate that the message itself failed
to apply. Actors may not call `vm::abort` with any system exit code.

| Code  | Status                     | Description                                                |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | `SysErrSenderInvalid`      | sender doesn't exist                                       |
| 2     | `SysErrSenderStateInvalid` | message sender is not in a valid state to send the message |
| 3     | reserved                   |                                                            |
| 4     | `SysErrIllegalInstruction` | message receiver trapped                                   |
| 5     | `SysErrInvalidReceiver`    | receiver doesn't exist and can't be automatically created  |
| 6     | `SysErrInsufficientFunds`  | sender didn't have the requisite funds                     |
| 7     | `SysErrOutOfGas`           | out of gas                                                 |
| 8     | reserved                   |                                                            |
| 9     | `SysErrIllegalExitCode`    | message receiver aborted with an system exit code          |
| 10    | `SysErrAssertionFailed`    | some internal assertion failed                             |
| 11    | `SysErrMissingReturn`      | the actor returned a block handle that doesn't exist       |
| 13-15 | reserved                   |                                                            |

Notes:

1. If a message sender doesn't exist on-chain, the VM will return a receipt with the
   `ExitCode::SysErrSenderInvalid` exit code.
2. If an actor calls `vm::abort` with a system exit code, that exit code will be replaced with
   `ExitCode::SysErrIllegalExitCode`.
3. If an actor [traps][trap] (often a memory violation), the exit code
   `ExitCode::SysErrIllegalInstruction` will be returned. User-level assertions (e.g., a go/rust
   panic, an uncaught exception, etc.) should cleanly abort with `ExitCode::ErrAssertionFailed`.
   `ExitCode::SysErrIllegalInstruction` means that the actor failed in a way that it couldn't (or
   didn't) handle itself.
4. If a message runs out of gas, the VM will return a receipt with the `ExitCode::SysErrOutOfGas`
   exit code.
5. Most of these exit codes are only reflected on-chain and will not be observed in internal sends.
   The exceptions are:
    - `SysErrIllegalExitCode` if the called actor aborted with a system exit code.
    - `SysErrIllegalInstruction` if the called actor crashed.
    - `SysErrMissingReturn` if the actor returns an invalid block handle.

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

1. Removed `ExitCode::SysErrInvalidMethod` (3). Dispatch is now handled inside actor code which
   should exit with the equivalent `ExitCode::ErrUnhandledMessage`.
2. Removed `ExitCode::SysErrForbidden` (8). Caller verification is a userspace operation, we'll now
   exit with `ExitCode::ErrForbidden`.
3. Replaced `ExitCode::SysErrIllegalArgument` with `ExitCode::SysErrAssertionFailed` to more
   accurately reflect its usage. When this appears on-chain, it means that a message hit some
   internal Filecoin assert that shouldn't happen.

### Standard Non-Zero Exit  Codes

Standard non-zero exit codes are codes returned by actors to indicate common failure conditions.

| Code  | Status                 | Description                                         |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 16    | `ErrIllegalArgument`   | invalid message parameters                          |
| 17    | `ErrNotFound`          | message referenced something that doesn't exist     |
| 18    | `ErrForbidden`         | operation forbidden                                 |
| 19    | `ErrInsufficientFunds` | insufficient funds for operation                    |
| 20    | `ErrIllegalState`      | the actor is in an illegal state                    |
| 21    | `ErrSerialization`     | actor failed to serialize or deserialize some state |
| 22    | `ErrUnhandledMessage`  | actor cannot handle this message                    |
| 23    | `ErrUnspecified`       | the actor failed with an unspecified error          |
| 24    | `ErrAssertionFailed`   | the actor failed some user-level assertion          |
| 25-31 | reserved               |                                                     |

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

1. Added `ExitCode::ErrUnhandledMessage` (replacing `ExitCode::SysErrInvalidMethod`).
2. Added `ExitCode::ErrUnspecified`. This indicates that something unspecified went wrong, but we
   don't know what the cause is. This is a sane default exit code when accurately determining the
   underlying error is expensive, unreliable, complex, etc.
3. Added `ExitCode::ErrAssertionFailed`. This means that the actor failed some user-level assertion
   (e.g., the actor paniced, threw an uncaught exception, etc.).

## Syscall Error Numbers

Syscall error numbers (`ErrorNumber`) are returned by syscalls to actors. They indicate that the
syscall failed (without any side effects). The actor may choose to handle the error and continue, or
abort (usually with one of the standard non-zero exit codes).

A return value of "0" means that the syscall succeeded.

| Number | Name                | Description                                            |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `IllegalArgument`   | invalid syscall parameters                             |
| 2      | `IllegalOperation`  | actor is not in the correct state to perform operation |
| 3      | `LimitExceeded`     | some limit was exceeded (e.g. lookback limit)          |
| 4      | `AssertionFailed`   | some internal assertion failed                         |
| 5      | `InsufficientFunds` | attempted to send more than balance                    |
| 6      | `NotFound`          | resource not found                                     |
| 7      | `InvalidHandle`     | block handle invalid                                   |
| 8      | `IllegalCid`        | cid creation parameters (hash/length) were invalid     |
| 9      | `IllegalCodec`      | specified codec is not allowed                         |
| 10     | `Serialization`     | block format did not match specified codec             |
| 11     | `Forbidden`         | operation is forbidden                                 |

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

Before the FVM, Filecoin didn't have a concept of syscall error numbers, only exit codes. However:

1. Pre-FVM, most syscalls returned string errors with no exit codes attached.
2. There is no reliable mapping from syscall errors to exit codes. For example:

    1. If a syscall returns with `ErrorNumber::IllegalArgument`, it means that an illegal argument was passed
       to the syscall.
    2. If an actor exits with `ExitCode::ErrIllegalArgument`, it means the message parameters weren't allowed.

    1 does not imply 2. An actor may pass illegal arguments to a syscall due to a bug in the actor,
    illegal state, etc.

**Notes:**

- We intentionally use `ErrorNumber::IllegalArgument` instead of `ErrorNumber::Serialization` in
    non-IPLD syscalls, even if we're using CBOR.
- `ErrorNumber::AssertionFailed` is a special error that indicates that some internal assertion
    failed and that there is likely something wrong with a system actor or the Filecoin state-tree
    itself. It exists to allow the network to continue in the face of bugs where the network
    continuing is likely less harmful than the bug itself.

    It can't be caught by normal actors (and turns into a `ExitCode::SysErrAssertionFailed`
    exit code on-chain), but may be caught by some system actors (e.g., cron).

    Uses:

    - `actor::create_actor` fails because the init actor is in a bad state.
    - `actor::resolve_address` fails because the init actor is in a bad state.

reflected in the exit code contained in the syscall's return value.
